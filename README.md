# Password-generator

This is a simple web application that generates a password based on user-selected options. Users can specify the length of the password (between 4 and 24 characters) and choose whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

<h2>Getting started</h2>
To use this application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The application will load, and you will see a text input field displaying the generated password, a range input to select the password length, and several checkboxes to select the desired character types.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Specify the length of the password using the range input. The minimum length is 4 characters, and the maximum length is 24 characters. The default length is 8 characters.

Check the checkboxes for the character types you want to include in your password. You can choose lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (!-?).

Click the "Generate password" button to create a new password. The password will be displayed in the text input field.

When the "Generate password" button is clicked, the password is automatically copied in your clipboard.
